- Seperation of Concerns
    - Presentation Layer --> console I/O (i.e. numerical menu)
    - Logic Layer --> processes user input, validations (error handling)
    - Data Access Layer --> manages interactions w/ database 

- Have persistence (data continues to exist after program ends; ex. file I/O)
    - 

- Minimum of 2 class objects/models

- Unit Testing (JUnit)
    - At least 10 indiviudal tests
    - Mock the repo layer
    - Should have happy path, negative results, and edge cases
    - Apply TDD (test driven development) for one method

- Ideas: sports league database, store inventory app,
